1. Define Functions for Operations:
- Create functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function takes two parameters and returns the result.

2. Define the Main Function:
- Display a welcome message and operation choices to the user.
- Start an infinite loop to handle user input.

3. Input Handling:
- Ask the user to select an operation (1, 2, 3, or 4).
- If the choice is valid, prompt the user for two numbers.
- Perform the chosen operation using the appropriate function and display the result.
- Exit the loop after performing the calculation.

4. Error Handling:
- If the user enters an invalid choice or non-numeric values, display an error message and prompt again.

5.Main Program Execution:
- Ensure the `main()` function is called if the script is executed directly.
